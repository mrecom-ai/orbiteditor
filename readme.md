## Download

Orbit Editor is currently in **beta** and available for **macOS** (Apple Silicon and Intel). Windows and Linux support is coming soon.

**Recommended — one-line install (no Gatekeeper warning):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashish200729/orbiteditor/main/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads and installs Orbit into `/Applications` via `curl`, which never
tags the app with macOS's `com.apple.quarantine` flag — so it launches with **no
Gatekeeper prompt**, on any Mac, with no Apple Developer account required.

**Alternative — download the `.dmg`** from
[Releases](https://github.com/ashish200729/orbiteditor/releases) or
[orbiteditorai.com](https://orbiteditorai.com), then drag Orbit to Applications.
Because Orbit is not (yet) notarized by Apple, a DMG downloaded through a browser
is quarantined and macOS shows *"Apple could not verify Orbit is free of
malware."* Bypass it once, any of:

- Right-click `Orbit.app` → **Open** → **Open Anyway**, or
- System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Open Anyway**, or
- Terminal: `xattr -cr /Applications/Orbit.app`
