Review the current git diff in depth and make it production-ready. Work directly in this session — do not delegate to sub-agents.

Scope: @src/vs/workbench/contrib/orbit/ @src/vs/workbench/contrib/orbit/browser/react/

Requirements:
- Inspect every changed file in the diff; fix bugs, type errors, UI regressions, and edge cases.
- Use StrReplace for targeted edits and Write only when rewriting a whole file.
- Sub-agent tooling is broken in places — trace call sites, fix policy/wiring, and verify explore/plan/generalPurpose agents behave correctly.
- Keep legacy chat history rendering working (LEGACY_TOOL_NAME_MAP and related fallbacks).
- Reuse existing Orbit React components, theme tokens, and established patterns — no unrelated refactors.
- Run `npm run buildreact` and `npm run compile-client` after substantive changes; fix any failures.
- Do not break unrelated behavior. Prefer minimal, correct diffs over broad rewrites.

When the diff is clean, builds pass, and edge cases are handled, stop.
